about:
  description: >-
    In 2014, I taught myself how to code as a hobby. Three year later, I decided
    to take a risk to pursue a career as a web developer. I resigned from my job
    and attended a 3-month web development immersive program. Currently, Iâ€™m
    employed as a frontend software engineer at WebPT where I build web
    applications in React.
