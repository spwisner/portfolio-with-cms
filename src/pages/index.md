about:
  description: >-
    In 2014, I taught myself how to code and this became a hobby. Three year
    later, I decided to take a risk and made my hobby a career. I resigned from
    my job and attended a 3-month web development immersive program. Currently,
    Iâ€™m employed as a frontend software engineer at Business.com where I build
    web applications in React.
