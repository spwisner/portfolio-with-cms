  description: >-
    In 2014, I taught myself how to code and this became a hobby. Three year
    later, I decided to take a risk and made my hobby a career. I resigned from
    my job and attended a 3-month web development immersive program. Currently,
    I’m employed as a frontend software engineer at Business.com where I build
    web applications in React.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
