## **Project Benefits**:

The greatest strength of PDG was its speed and universal compatibility. When testing PDG, results for 500 properties were retrieve and formatted in a new spreadsheet in 14 seconds. Also, PDG was designed to be universally compatible. The application was available for download for both macOS and Windows operating systems. Also, the results spreadsheet is autogenerated as a CSV file, ensuring that it can be used with Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, Google Sheets, and virtually all other software.
