In 2014, I taught myself how to code and this became a hobby. Three year later, I decided to take a risk and made my hobby a career. I resigned from my job and attended a 3-month web development immersive program. Currently, Iâ€™m employed as a frontend software engineer at Business.com where I build web applications in React.
